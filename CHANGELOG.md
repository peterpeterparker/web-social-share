# [6.2.0](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/web-social-share/compare/v6.1.0...v6.2.0) (2019-07-30)

### Fix

- refactor component to avoid the need to move slots in order to be compatible with Font Awesome (CSS import) ([#18](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/web-social-share/issues/18))

### Special note

There isn't any "breaking changes" but according the type and how you style your icons, you might need to change some CSS variables to keep styles in terms of size the same way.

For example I had to change `width` to `font-size` in the [index.html](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/web-social-share/blob/208362a6eb53e30d191f0b095223f2cd0b8a637d/src/index.html#L77) of the component.

From:

```
<i class="fab fa-twitter" slot="twitter" style="color: #00aced; width: 1.4rem;"></i>
```

To:

```
<i class="fab fa-twitter" slot="twitter" style="color: #00aced; font-size: 1.6rem;"></i>
```

# [5.0.0](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/web-social-share/compare/v4.0.2...v5.0.0) (2019-02-17)

### Breaking changes

- transform component to a shadowed Web Component ([#14](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/web-social-share/issues/14))

Notes:

As of version v5.0.0 this Web Component will be shadowed. Therefore, you will have to use `slots` to inject the icons for the sharing actions and will have to style these in order to apply for example the proper colors. The README of the component has been updated to reflect these changes.

If you would miss variables to style the component, ping me, I would be happy to add more options.
